# Web Dev Package Installation Automation
###### For Ubuntu 15

This is a collection of shell scripts that install selected web dev packages and tools. It also fixes/works-around some of the installation problems associated with these packages. C.f. comments in scripts for individual author attribution.
Although it may work for Ubuntu < 15 (or other distros), I have not tested for other versions -- user beware.

### Included:
Node.js
Express.js
Grunt cli
GraphicsMagick

Compass
MongoDB
Vagrant
